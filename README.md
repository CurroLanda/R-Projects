# 📊 R-Projects

Welcome to the **R-Projects** repository! This repository contains outputs from various **R Studio** notebooks, focusing on **data visualization**, **analysis**, and **machine learning**. Below is a summary of the main projects included:

### 🛳️ Titanic Projects
- **Visualization & Data Analysis**: Explore detailed visualizations and analysis of the infamous Titanic dataset. We delve into the data to uncover insights about the passengers and the tragic incident.
- **Decision Tree Classifier**: A predictive model built using a **Decision Tree Classifier** to better understand the factors influencing survival. This project enhances the complexity of the analysis by predicting outcomes based on passenger data.

### 🍷 Wine Dataset Project
- **Preprocessing & Clustering**: Dive into a dataset of wine characteristics, where we applied various preprocessing techniques followed by **clustering algorithms** to group wines based on their attributes.
